\chapter{Factorization of derivations}
\lcha{factorization}

As we observed in the two examples at the end of last chapter,
when we take a derivation from the lambda calculus and project it
to the distributive lambda calculus, we may end up with the empty derivation.

Remember that if we have a term $\tm' \in \termsdist$ that refines a $\tm \in \terms$,
$\tm'$ represents in some way a head normal form of $\tm$.
Intuitively, derivations in $\ulbDerivLam{\tm}$ that map to the empty derivation in
$\ulbDerivDist{\tm'}$ will be derivations that don't do work towards carrying
$\tm$ to the head normal form represented by $\tm'$.
