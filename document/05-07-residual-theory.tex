In this section we will develop the theory of residuals of the $\lambdadist$-calculus.
The basic concepts of general rewriting theory where outlined in \rsec{rewriting_theory_preliminaries},
and we will now concentrate in the specifics of our calculus.

It is interesting to develop a theory of residuals for $\lambdadist$ because
residuals allow us to trace a redex through a reduction of a term.
Given that the purpose of $\lambdadist$ is to be able to track
how resources are used in $\lambda$-terms, it is crucial to
be able to trace these resources during a reduction.
