\lcha{simulation}

In this chapter we will focus on establishing a correspondance between
the $\lambda$-calculus and the $\lambdadist$-calculus.

First, we will learn how to relate terms from one calculus to terms in the other,
via what we call \emph{refinements}.
Then, we will look at how the derivation spaces of two related terms are connected.
After that we will learn that the fact that a term of the lambda calculus is
related to another in the distributive lambda calculus
says that it has a head normal form.
Finally, we will link and combine the residual theories of both calculi.


\begin{notation}
If $\tm$ is a term of the distributive lambda calculus,
we already defined $\ulbDerivDist{\tm}$ to be its derivation space,
which we proved is a distributive lattice.
$\termsdist$ is the set of all (correct) terms.

If $\tmtwo$ is a term of the pure lambda calculus,
we write $\ulbDerivLam{\tmtwo}$ to mean
the derivation space of $\tmtwo$, which
is an join semilattice.
$\terms$ is the set of all terms of the pure lambda calculus.
\end{notation}
