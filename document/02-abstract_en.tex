In typical non-idempotent intersection type systems, proof normalization is not confluent.
In this work we introduce a confluent non-idempotent intersection type system for the $\lambda$-calculus.
Typing derivations are presented using a concise proof term syntax.
The system enjoys good properties: subject reduction, strong normalization,
and a very regular theory of residuals.
A correspondence with the $\lambda$-calculus is established by simulation theorems.

The machinery of non-idempotent intersection types allows us to track the usage of
resources required to obtain an answer.
In particular, it induces a notion of \textit{garbage}: a computation is garbage
if it does not contribute to obtaining an answer.
Using these notions,
we show that the derivation space of a $\lambda$-term may be factorized using a
variant of the Grothendieck construction for semilattices.
This means, in particular, that any derivation in the $\lambda$-calculus can be
uniquely written as a garbage-free prefix followed by garbage.
