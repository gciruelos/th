\chapter{A distributive $\lambda$-calculus}
\lcha{lambdadist}

In this chapter we present a
{\em distributive $\lambda$-calculus} ($\lambdadist$),
and we prove some basic properties it enjoys.
Following that, we give develop a theory of residuals for our calculus and talk
about the structure of the derivation spaces of its terms.
To finish, we establish a relation between our calculus and the pure lambda-calculus
that will allow us to prove interesting results in the next chapter.

Terms of the $\lambdadist$-calculus are typing derivations of a non-idempotent intersection type
system, written using proof term syntax.
The underlying type system is a variant of
system~$\mathcal{W}$ of \cite{bucciarelli2014inhabitation,bucciarelli2017non},
the main difference being that $\lambdadist$
uses {\em labels} and a suitable invariant on terms,
to ensure that the formal parameters of all functions
are in 1--1 correspondence with the actual arguments that they receive.
