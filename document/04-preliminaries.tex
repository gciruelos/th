\section{Order theory}

We need to introduce some concepts from this theory because, as we have seen,
the structure of derivation spaces of $\lambda$ terms may be seen as an order,
where the elements of the set are derivations, and the order is.

An \defn{upper semilattice} is a poset (i.e., a set $A$  with an order relation $\leq$), such that
there is a least element $\bot \in A$
In particular, we will  start defining what an \textit{upper semilattice} is.
